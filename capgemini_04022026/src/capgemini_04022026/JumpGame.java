/*
 * Problem Statement:
 * You are given an array of non-negative integers where each element represents the maximum jump length at that position. 
 * Your goal is to determine if you can reach the last index starting from the first index.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
 * 
 * Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
