## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SatoruZati/capgemini_training.git
cd capgemini_training
```

### Setting Up in Eclipse

1. Open Eclipse IDE
2. Go to `File` → `Import` → `Existing Projects into Workspace`
3. Select the root directory of the cloned repository
4. Select the specific day's project you want to explore
5. Click `Finish`

### Setting Up in IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Select `File` → `Open`
3. Navigate to a specific day's directory (e.g., `capgemini_07012026`)
4. Click `OK` to open the project

## 💻 Usage

### Running Individual Programs

Each Java file contains a `main` method that can be executed independently:

1. Navigate to the desired Java file in your IDE
2. Right-click on the file
3. Select `Run As` → `Java Application` (Eclipse) or click the Run button (IntelliJ)

### Example: Running an Arithmetic Operations Program

```bash
cd capgemini_training/capgemini_10012026/src
javac Package03/arithmetic_operations.java
java Package03.arithmetic_operations
```

### Exploring Topics

- Browse through each day's folder to see the progression of concepts
- Each file is self-contained with examples demonstrating specific concepts
- Comments in the code provide additional context and explanations
- **Check the `package-info.java` file in each folder for comprehensive notes on topics covered**

## 📖 Learning Path

For optimal learning, it's recommended to go through the directories in chronological order:

1. Start with `capgemini_07012026` for Java basics
2. Progress through each subsequent directory
3. Complete the practice exercises in each section
4. Review the examples and modify them to experiment with concepts
