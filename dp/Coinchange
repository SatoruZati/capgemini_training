1️⃣ What is the Coin Change Problem? (Very Simple)

You are given:

Some coin denominations

A target amount

👉 You need to make the amount using these coins

There are two famous versions:

Number of ways to make the amount

We’ll start with Minimum Coins (interview favorite).

2️⃣ Simple Example
Coins = {1, 2, 5}
