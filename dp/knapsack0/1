1️⃣ What is the 0/1 Knapsack Problem? (Very simple words)

Imagine:

You have a bag (knapsack) that can carry limited weight

You have items, each item has:

Weight

Value (profit)

You want to maximize total value

You cannot break items

You either take the whole item or don’t take it

👉 0/1 means:

0 → not taken

1 → taken

Example (Real-life thinking)
Item	Weight	Value
A	1	10
B	2	15
C	3	40

Knapsack capacity = 5

Goal:
👉 Pick items so that total weight ≤ 5
👉 Total value is maximum

2️⃣ Criteria / Rules to follow (Very Important)

You MUST follow these rules in 0/1 Knapsack:

✅ Rule 1: Each item can be used only once

You cannot repeat the same item

✅ Rule 2: Item is either taken or not taken

No partial selection

You can’t take half an item

✅ Rule 3: Total weight must not exceed capacity

If capacity is 5, weight must be ≤ 5

✅ Rule 4: Goal is to maximize value, not weight

Weight is a constraint

Value is the target

3️⃣ Why do we use Dynamic Programming (DP)?
Problem with brute force

If you try all combinations, time becomes very large (2ⁿ).

DP idea (simple language)

“Solve small problems first and reuse their answers”

We build a table where:

Rows → items

Columns → knapsack capacity

4️⃣ DP Table Meaning (Most Important Part)

Let:

dp[i][w]
Meaning:

Maximum value we can get using first i items with capacity w

DP decision logic (heart of the problem)

For each item:

1️⃣ If item weight > current capacity
➡ Cannot take it
➡ Copy previous value

dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]

2️⃣ If item weight ≤ current capacity
➡ Choose maximum of:

Not taking item

Taking item

dp[i][w] = max(
    dp[i-1][w],                      // not take
    value[i] + dp[i-1][w - weight[i]] // take
)
5️⃣ Visual DP Table (Conceptual)

Example capacity = 5
Items = 3

        Capacity →
Items ↓   0  1  2  3  4  5
--------------------------------
0 items   0  0  0  0  0  0
Item 1    0 10 10 10 10 10
Item 2    0 10 15 25 25 25
Item 3    0 10 15 40 50 55  ✅

👉 Final answer = dp[3][5] = 55
