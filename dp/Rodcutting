1️⃣ What is the Rod Cutting Problem? (Very Simple)

You are given:

A rod of length N

A price list where:

price[i] = price of rod piece of length i

Your task:

👉 Cut the rod in any way
👉 Sell the pieces
👉 Get maximum total profit

💡 You can cut the rod any number of times.

2️⃣ Simple Example (Understand First)

Rod length = 4

Piece Length	1	2	3	4
Price        	2	5	7	8

Possible ways:

4 → price = 8

2 + 2 → 5 + 5 = 10 ✅

1 + 3 → 2 + 7 = 9

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 → 8

👉 Maximum profit = 10

3️⃣ Important Rules / Criteria
✅ Rule 1: Rod can be cut into any number of pieces

(Unlike 0/1 Knapsack)

✅ Rule 2: You can use the same length again

(Unbounded problem)

✅ Rule 3: Order of pieces does NOT matter
✅ Rule 4: Goal is to maximize total price
4️⃣ Why Dynamic Programming?
Brute force problem:

Try all cut combinations ❌

Exponential time

DP idea:

“For each rod length, store the maximum profit possible”

5️⃣ DP Meaning (MOST IMPORTANT)

Let:

dp[i]
Meaning:

Maximum profit obtainable from rod of length i

6️⃣ DP Relation (Core Logic)

For rod length i:

Try all possible first cuts:

dp[i] = max(price[j] + dp[i - j])
where j = 1 to i

💡 Meaning:

Cut a piece of length j

Remaining rod = i - j

Add best profit of remaining part
