// Encapsulation notes
/*
 * Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts.
 * The other three are Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
 * 
 * Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) 
 * and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
 * 
 * In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes,
 * and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
 * Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.
 * 
 * To achieve encapsulation in Java:
 * 1. Declare the variables of a class as private.
 * 2. Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables' values.
 * 
 */

// encapsulation is hiding the data members of a class by declaring them as private
// and providing public getter and setter methods to access and update the value of private variables.

// the only accessibility to the private variables is through the public methods of the class.
