		// Strong relationship example: Composition
		// Weak relationship example: Association
		
		// Relationships in Java are established through references between objects.
		// In composition, one class contains a reference to another class, indicating a strong relationship.
		// In association, classes can reference each other without strong ownership.
		
		// Aggregation is a specialized form of association with a whole-part relationship.
		
		// Inheritance establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.
		
		// Relationships in java are used to model real-world scenarios and define how objects interact with each other.

		// example of relationships in java: 
		// 1. Composition: A car has an engine (strong relationship)
		// 2. Association: A teacher teaches a student (weak relationship)
		// 3. Aggregation: A university has multiple departments (whole-part relationship)
		// 4. Inheritance: A dog is an animal (is-a relationship)
		
		// based on human body, java relationships can be explained as:
		// 1. Composition: A human body has a heart (strong relationship)
		// 2. Association: A doctor treats a patient (weak relationship)
		// 3. Aggregation: A family has multiple members (whole-part relationship)
		// 4. Inheritance: A cat is an animal (is-a relationship)
		
		// employee-manager is a strong relationship because an employee cannot exist without a manager in a hierarchical structure.
		// manager can exist without an employee, but employees as a whole-part are typically associated with a manager.
